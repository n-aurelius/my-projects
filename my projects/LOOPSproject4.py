# to create 50 meows without copy and pasting it lets use the following path

i = 3
while i != 0:
    print("meow")
    i = i - 1
# we used i = 3 and added a question that say i is not equal to o. now the loop starts
# first 3 subtracts from 1 and we get a 2. then loop happens and 2 subtracts from 1 we get 1. loop happens 1-1 is zero the end cuz 0-1 is false and doesnt work
